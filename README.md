# resignment-intention-project
Our final project for our Artificial Intelligence and Data Science class. Tasked with a large dataset, we were instructed to **explore the dataset, analyze it, and make machine learning models to help the company make better data driven decisions**.

For our project, we were given a dataset about **resignment intention** in a company. Our tasks included:
1. Visualizing the characteristics of employees that wanted to resign.
2. Finding out if employees choose to resign after getting a promotion.
3. Finding out which department has the most loyal employees.
4. Analyzing the correlations of all the attributes in the dataset.
5. Making machine learning models to predict resignment intention and how long an employee would work at that company.
6. Analyzing and visualiziing clusters that could be made from the dataset.
